# The-Pendulum
The exploration of pendulum dynamics encapsulates foundational principles of classical  mechanics, offering profound insights into the fundamental laws governing physical systems.  Pendulums, characterized by a mass suspended from a fixed point, serve as examples of  oscillatory motion under the influence of gravity
